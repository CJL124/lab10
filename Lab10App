/**
 * <p>Title: The Lab 10 Application Class</p>
 *
 * <p>Description: This Application class utilizes the methods in the Student and Course classes and outputs information. This is where we can get the total number
 *  of students in the course and add students to the course with their ID, First and Last names, and grades for 4 exams. With this information we can compare the
 *  students grades to find the index of the student with the lowest score. We can also find the average of a specific exam taking into account grades from every 
 *  student in the course.</p>
